SEC Scrape - Aug 2018

SEC Scrape will download 10-Ks from www.sec.gov and save them as .html files. Then, this program will scrape all 
of the tables from the html file and then output them. This is useful because it can find hard-to-find data such 
as operating leases, minority holdings, etc. 

Use Main.py and functions like download(), getConsolidatedFinancials(), and getOpLease()
